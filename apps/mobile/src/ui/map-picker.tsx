/**
 * A real map to put a pin on, on a device.
 *
 * ADR-0005 said no in-app map, and the reasoning was sound at the time: a map
 * SDK means a Google or Mapbox key, a billing account and a geocoder, none of
 * which makes a delivery arrive faster in a city where addresses are
 * landmarks. What it did not weigh is that a landmark address plus *no* point
 * leaves a courier guessing, and «قرب صيدلية النور» is only unambiguous to
 * somebody who already knows the street.
 *
 * So: Leaflet and OpenStreetMap tiles inside a WebView. No key, no billing
 * account, no SDK in the binary — a hundred lines of HTML and a tile server
 * that has served the world's maps for twenty years. The web preview renders
 * the same document directly (`map-picker.web.tsx`), so what a reviewer sees
 * in a browser is the map the phone draws.
 *
 * It picks a point and reports it back. It does not geocode, search, or route;
 * the driver's own maps app does the routing, and it is better at it.
